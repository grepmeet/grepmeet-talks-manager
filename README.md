### 👥 A community

A recurring time to meet and help each other to keep communities alive. Whether you're a beginner or an expert, anyone can propose a grepmeet!

## 🤔 Why is this project useful?

Most "meetups" are irregular! It is a volunteer organizer who holds a whole community hostage, in spite of himself. All it takes is for his workload to increase 🤯 or his family situation to change 👶🍼 for events to disappear for months at a time.

The goal of grepmeet.org is to offer a simple and automated solution to keep events going by relieving organizers of this task. The latter, if they wish, become speakers, moderators or animators.
